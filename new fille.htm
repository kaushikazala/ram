        Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently one of the hottest buzzwords in tech and with good reason. <br> 
        The last few years have seen several innovations and advancements that <br>
        have previously been solely in the realm of science fiction slowly transform into reality. <br>
        Experts regard artificial intelligence as a factor of production, <br>
        which has the potential to introduce new sources of growth and change the way work is <br>
        done across industries. For instance, this PWC article predicts that AI could potentially contribute $15.7 trillion <br>
        to the global economy by 2035. <br>
        China and the United States are primed to benefit the most from the coming AI boom,
        accounting for nearly 70% of the global impact.</p>
